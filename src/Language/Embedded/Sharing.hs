-- | Utilities for working with abstract syntax trees with \"transparent\" sharing
--
-- The type 'DAG' represents ASTs with sharing. It is a term with an extra form of let binding,
-- called 'Def' and separate variables for referring to those bindings.
--
-- It is sometimes desired to ignore the sharing structure when traversing or transforming 'DAG's.
-- The sharing structure is then only there to give a compact representation, and should not affect
-- the semantics of the traversal or transformation. The functions 'foldDAG' and 'expose' support
-- this kind of programming by dealing with sharing under the hood.

-- | Expose the top-most constructor in a 'DAG' given an environment of definitions in scope. It
-- works roughly as follows:
--
-- * 'Def' binders at the top are removed and gathered in a list of local definitions.
--
-- * If the top-most node (after removing local definitions) is a 'Ref' variable, its unfolding
--   (coming either in the environment or from the local definitions) is returned and 'expose'd.
--
-- * Otherwise, the local definitions of the node are distributed down to the children, which
--   ensures that the (call-by-name) semantics of the 'DAG' is not affected.
--
-- When calling @`expose` env t@, it is assumed that @`addDefs` env t@ does not have any free 'Ref'
-- variables. It is also assumed that all definitions in `env` have unique names (i.e. that
-- @map fst env@ has no duplicates).

  where

-- In the `Ref` case, it is important to throw away the first part of `ds` because otherwise those
-- bindings can capture variables in `t'`. (If `v` is found in `env` rather than in `ds`, there
-- could also be definitions in the first part of `env` that capture variables in `t'`, but this
-- won't happen due to the assumption that `env` has unique identifiers (and this is the reason why
-- we need that assumption).)

  -- Important to fold from the right, since earlier definitions may depend on later ones
