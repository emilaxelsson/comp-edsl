-- | Utilities for working with abstract syntax trees with \"transparent\" sharing
--
-- The type 'DAG' represents ASTs with sharing. It is essentially a normal term with let binders.
-- But instead of using 'Let', this module uses a functor transformer 'DAGF' that allows adds a
-- special kind of let binding 'DLet' and a corresponding variable 'DVar' constructor.
--
-- It is sometimes desired to ignore the sharing structure when traversing or transforming 'DAG's.
-- The sharing structure is then only there to give a compact representation, and should not affect
-- the semantics of the traversal or transformation. The functions 'foldDAG' and 'expose' support
-- this kind of programming by dealing with sharing under the hood.

-- | Expose the top-most constructor in a 'DAG' given an environment of definitions in scope. It

-- * 'DLet' binders at the top are removed and gathered in a list of local definitions.
--
-- * If the top-most node (after removing local definitions) is a 'DVar' variable, its unfolding
--   (coming either in the environment or from the local definitions) is returned and 'expose'd.
--
-- * Otherwise, the local definitions of the node are distributed down to the children, which
--   ensures that the (call-by-name) semantics of the 'DAG' is not affected.
--
-- When calling @`expose` env t@, it is assumed that @`addDefs` env t@ does not have any free 'DVar'
-- variables. It is also assumed that all definitions in `env` have unique names (i.e. that
-- @map fst env@ has no duplicates).
