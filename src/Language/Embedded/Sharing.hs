-- | Utilities for working with abstract syntax trees with sharing
--
-- The type 'DAG' represents ASTs with sharing. It is essentially a normal term with let
-- binders; however, instead of 'Let', this module uses a functor transformer 'Where' that allows
-- attaching a number of local definitions to each node in an AST.
--
-- The functions 'dagToTerm' and 'termToDAG' go back and forth between terms with 'Where' and 'Let'
-- for local binders.
--
-- It is often desired to ignore the sharing structure when transforming 'DAG's. The sharing
-- structure is then only there to give a compact representation, and should not affect the
-- semantics of the term. Such transformations can be written using 'expose', which looks through
-- the sharing structure and exposes the top-most constructor for pattern matching.

-- | Fold a term by treating sharing transparently. The semantics is as if all sharing is inlined,

-- semantics.

-- | Expose the top-most constructor in a 'DAG' given an environment of definitions in scope.
-- It works roughly as follows:
--
-- * If the top-most node is a variable that has a definition in scope (either in the environment or
--   in the local 'Defs' attached to the node), this definition is returned and 'expose'd.
--
-- * Otherwise, the local definitions of the node are distributed down to the children, which
--   ensures that the (call by name) semantics of the 'DAG' is not affected.
--
-- This function assumes that variables and binders are exactly those recognized by the methods of
-- the 'HasVars' class, except for 'Where' which also binds variables.
